/**
 * Madanapalle Institute of Technology & Science (MITS) - Training & Placement Cell Profiles
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * HOW TO MODIFY PLACEMENT & TRAINING TEAM DETAILS / DISPLAY POSITION
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 1. HOW TO CHANGE DISPLAY POSITION (REORDER):
 *    - The list of placement team members is defined in the `placementTeamData` array.
 *    - Rearrange the objects inside the `placementTeamData` array to change the display
 *      order on the Placements page.
 * 
 * 2. HOW TO ADD A NEW MEMBER:
 *    - Add a new object inside `placementTeamData` following the `PlacementFacultyProfile` interface.
 *    - Ensure you specify `team: "placement"` for placement officers, or `team: "training"` for trainers.
 * 
 * 3. HOW TO EDIT DETAILS:
 *    - Locate the member by name and edit the designation, qualification, email, or sections array.
