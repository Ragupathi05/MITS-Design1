  intro: [
  "In pursuance of its Action Plan for performance evaluation, assessment & accreditation & quality up-gradation of institutions of higher education, NAAC proposes that every accredited institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a post-accreditation quality sustenance measure. Since quality enhancement is a continuous process, the IQAC will become a part of the institution's system & work towards realisation of the goals of quality enhancement & sustenance.",
  "The guidelines within the following pages will direct and support Madanapalle Institute of Technology & Science (MITS) in establishing and operating the Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC). The IQAC's role is the initial phase in internalizing and institutionalizing quality enhancement initiatives at MITS. Its success hinges on its ability to foster a sense of belonging and active involvement among all the institution's members.",
  "It won't function as another hierarchical structure or a mere record-keeping exercise; instead, it will serve as a facilitating and participatory voluntary entity within MITS. It possesses the potential to serve as a catalyst for enhancing quality by implementing planned interventionist strategies to address deficiencies and elevate quality, similar to the concept of 'Quality Circles' in industries."
