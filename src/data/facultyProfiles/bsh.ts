/**
 * Faculty Profiles Data Schema
 * 
 * ============================================================================
 * HOW TO EDIT FACULTY PROFILE DATA (PUBLICATIONS, PATENTS, PROJECTS, ETC.)
 * ============================================================================
 * 
 * 1. HOW TO EDIT A SPECIFIC SECTION (e.g., Publication Details):
 *    - Each faculty member's profile is a dictionary entry. Under the `sections` array,
 *      each section has a `title` and a `content` array of objects (representing tables)
 *      or string/array of strings (representing bullet lists).
 *    - To add a publication or patent, locate the correct object under `content` and append
 *      or edit a row object matching the table column keys.
 * 
 * 2. HOW TO REORDER SECTIONS:
 *    - Rearrange the objects inside the `sections` array to change which tabs/sections
 *      display first on the faculty details page.
